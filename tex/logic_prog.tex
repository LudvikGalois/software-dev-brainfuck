\chapter{Logic Programming}

An introduction to logic programming

\section{Prolog}

\section{Implementing a ``Prolog''}

We'll depart from regular Prolog syntax, instead of adopting a more
familar lispy-syntax

\subsection{The Warren Abstract Machine (WAM)}

\subsection{Compiling Prolog to WAM}

\subsection{Extending Clojure}

The features provided by logic programming are often useful, and
whilst a logic program could be encoded in Clojure, it's often more
convenient for Clojure to know how to run a logic program. We can
embed the WAM into our Clojure environment, and write some macros to
compile and run prolog programs.
